You died on a Saturday morning. 
And I had you placed here under our tree. 
And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground. 
Momma always said dyin' was a part of life. 
I sure wish it wasn't. 
Little Forrest, he's doing just fine. 
About to start school again soon. 
I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. 
I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day. 
Teaching him how to play ping-pong. 
He's really good. 
We fish a lot. 
And every night, we read a book. 
He's so smart, Jenny. 
You'd be so proud of him. 
I am. He, uh, wrote a letter, and he says I can't read it. 
I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you. 
Jenny, I don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan. 
I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. 
Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. 
If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.
